                    Project Description: No Place For Hate

Within the last few years, acts of violence based on
blatant biases, also known as “hate crimes”, have
become a topic attracting a lot of public attention.
Looking at the news, it’s easy to assume that the
number of hate crimes is pretty significant and have
spiked over the last few years.

Using hate crime data from 2014 to 2018, we decided
to look at the datasets annually released by the FBI
and other sources to explore how socioeconomic
factors and and issues in the United States - like
poverty, unemployment rate, average household
income and level of education - affect the hate crime
rate.

… and we found the results surprising!


                                                             
                                               What is Hate Crime?

A crime, typically one involving violence, that is motivated by   
prejudice onthe basis of:
    Race
    Religion
    Sexual orientation
    Membership (or perceived membership) in an organization




                                                                                                                3

        Research Questions to Answer:                                   Data Sources Used:
•   What are the current hate crime rates in the US      •   Kaiser Family Foundation dataset, measuring
    and is there any region where hate crime is              hate crimes to socio-economic and race factors
    more prevalent?                                          as the main data set
•   Is there any connection between the                  •   Estimated crimes (1979-2018) released by FBI
    socioeconomic factors - poverty, unemployment        •   US Census Unemployment 1986-2018
    rate, average household income, level of             •   US Census Education 2014 - 2018
    education for the region - and hate crime            •   US Census Poverty Report
    occurrences?                                         •   US National Geographic Breakdown of US
                                                             Regions
•   Do hate crimes follow the same trends as the
    “regular crimes”? In other words, do the states
    with the highest overall crime rate also have a
    large “Place For Hate” crimes as well?
                                               Approach Applied
    • Merged the hate crime data set with demographic data sets to compare the data
    • Clean and format the data for consistency (had to drop 5 states, where data was not reported: Hawaii,
      North & South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming )
    • Created the the series of chart to visualise our analysis
    • Shaped out the conclusions

                                       Findings and Observations

-   What are the current hate crime rates in the US and is there any region where hate crime is more prevalent?
     - Based on the data we were able to obtain, the average occurrence of the hate crimes is the highest in the
         NorthEast region - 28.5% of the pool, with the highest number of hate crimes in the District of Columbia. The
         lowest number was observed in the SouthEast region (11.6% of the pool). Based on these observation, we
         assume that more hate crimes are reported in the urban areas
-   Is there any connection between the socioeconomic factors - poverty, unemployment rate, average household
    income, level of education for the region - and hate crime occurrences?
     -   We initially hypothesized that hate crime would be more prevalent in the Southern Regions, but after analyzing the socio-
         economic factors, we found that hate crimes occured in areas where the population was highly educated, more urban, and
         less poverty.
-   Do hate crimes follow the same trends as the “regular crimes”? In other words, do the states with the highest overall
    crime rate also have a large “Place For Hate” crimes as well?
     - The trends in the hate crime occurrences are very different than the trends other crimes. The states with the
         higher rate of “regular” crimes are not the states with the highest hate crime rate. Actually, it is quite opposite:
         the occurrence of “regular crimes” and “hate crimes” are negatively correlated. So, the hate crimes are a quite
         “different beast” and need an alter to be explored, explained and prevented differently.
    -    A major finding in this comparison is the difference in data values, which can have many different causes




                                                                                                                                 15
                                  What does this mean?
Major Finding:
• Hate crime data is smaller than we originally thought, and not in the regions we hypothesized. What
   could cause this?
    – A) Hate crime is committed at the a lower rate than we hypothesized
    – B) Hate crime is underreported
           – Hate crime is reported voluntarily
           – Some states don’t even report their hate crime data
           – When comparing to regular crime rate, it is significantly smaller (~ rate of 1.4 vs 20)
           – Some states have low reported hate crime rates than we are traditionally led to believe
           – Hate crimes are classified differently per state, and even per person you ask




                                                                                                        16
                                             Conclusion

First, as mentioned before, the datasets we’ve obtained are based on number of voluntary reported hate
crimes. Per our understanding, that are the crimes that have been LABELED and REPORTED as the hate
crimes… and this measure is not necessarily the same as the number of hate crimes that actually took
place

Second, it seems that in the areas with the higher level of education and medium household income (pretty
much urban areas) the rate of reported hate crimes is higher. The strongest linear correlation in
socioeconomic factors compared to hate crimes, is education. It may be explained by the higher
engagement of population in political and social trends and better ability to distinguish the hate crimes from
other ones and report them as the hate crimes.

Based on our observations, we believe that hate crimes are probably seriously under reported for
some regions and it creates the lack of visibility to the actual situation.

… on a side note, we could help noticing that California has the greatest number of “standard crimes”
committed. The second comes Texas. Well, everything is bigger in Texas...
